RMSE=Root Mean Square Error

Yu-Che Lin @ National Taiwan University

Goal:

    We use grid Search in SVM to find the best 'c', 'gamma'. To draw a distribution map of RMSE, we can distinguish which 'c' and 'gamma'
    is the best one

Step1. 

    python bestRMSE_function.py month c_step 
    return the best RMSE and 'c' and 'gamma'
